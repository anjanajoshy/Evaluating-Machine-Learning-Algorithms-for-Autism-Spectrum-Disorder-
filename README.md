# Evaluating-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-
This project investigates the use of machine learning (ML) models to improve the diagnosis of 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with the goal of determining the most effective algorithms for 
detecting ASD-related patterns in young children. The study uses a Kaggle dataset with 1,985 
records and 28 features that cover a variety of attributes such as demographic information, Autism 
Spectrum Quotient scores, and behavioural assessments. The methodology begins with data 
preprocessing, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA), then Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) 
models. The findings show that RF model emerged as the top performer for ASD diagnosis, 
showcasing high accuracy and precision. RF's superior performance was confirmed through 
confusion matrices and precision-recall curves, solidifying its effectiveness. Following closely 
behind, the SVM demonstrated balanced precision and recall, although slightly lower than RF. 
Conversely, LR showed lower accuracy, indicating a need for further optimization. The analysis 
reveals the strength of RF and SVM in ASD diagnosis, supporting the project's objective of 
integrating ML into ASD diagnostic frameworks. The study concludes that these models offer a 
promising approach for early ASD detection, with future work recommended to test the models' 
generalizability on other ASD-related datasets.
